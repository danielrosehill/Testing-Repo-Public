I am using submodules to build a documentation repository on Github.

The workflow is like this: I version documentation in feeder repositories that pull into a main repository (built with MK Docs). Then, that deploys onto Netlify.

I would like to create the following automation:

Every time I push changes to a feeder repo, then:

- The main repository is notified
- The main repository pulls in those changes
- The main repository builds

Here is an example feeder repo:

Here is the documentation root:
